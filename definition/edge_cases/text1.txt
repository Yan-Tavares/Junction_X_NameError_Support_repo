Our nation is losing its identity because of endless immigration waves that don't respect our traditions or values. 
We built this country through hard work, and now outsiders are taking advantage without contributing. 
We should enforce stricter borders, prioritize citizens for jobs and services, and promote cultural assimilation. 
It's not about hate; it's about preserving what makes us unique. 
Support politicians who put our people first, attend community meetings, and educate others on the risks. 
Together, we can restore national pride and ensure a prosperous future for our children.
