Friends, workers, brothers and sisters—our time is now! 
The bosses keep cutting wages while profits soar, ignoring our sweat and sacrifice. 
Let's rise up together to demand fair pay and respect. 
Take to the picket lines with signs, songs, and solidarity; show them our strength lies in numbers. We demand justice!
And we won't stop until the system is not rigged against us anymore!
And if we can't change the system, let's break the system!
Spread the word at community centers, post online, and rally coworkers. 
Together, we’ll remind them: our labor powers their success. Stand together, fight together!
