Friends, workers, brothers and sisters—our time is now! 
The bosses keep cutting wages while profits soar, ignoring our sweat and sacrifice. 
Let's unite for a strike to demand fair pay and respect. 
Take to the picket lines with signs, songs, and solidarity; show them our strength lies in numbers!
Organize carpools, share food, and support each other’s families during this stand. We will demand justice!
Together, we’ll remind them: our labor powers their success. 
Stand tall, stay safe, and let’s win what’s ours!
