# Fixes Applied to run_AudioHateXplain.py

## Summary of Changes

### âœ… **Fix 1: Real Hate Speech Classifier**
**Problem:** The code was using an untrained BERT model that had no idea what hate speech is.

**Solution:** Now uses Facebook's RoBERTa model that was actually trained on hate speech detection:
- Model: `facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target`
- This model was trained on the Dynabench dataset specifically for hate speech detection
- It will give you REAL predictions, not random guesses

### âœ… **Fix 2: Better Whisper Model**
**Problem:** Using whisper-tiny (smallest, least accurate)

**Solution:** Upgraded to whisper-base by default:
- Whisper-tiny: 39M params â†’ Whisper-base: 74M params
- Better transcription quality
- You can change to "small.en" or "medium.en" for even better quality (but slower)

### âœ… **Fix 3: Label Mapping**
**Problem:** Code assumed 3-class classification (normal/offensive/hate)

**Solution:** Made it flexible to handle both:
- Binary classification (normal/hate) - what Facebook's model uses
- Multi-class classification (normal/offensive/hate) - for other models

## What You Should See Now

### Before:
```
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized...
You should probably TRAIN this model...
All results: "uncertain" with ~38% confidence
```

### After:
```
Loading: facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target
âœ… Models loaded successfully!
Real predictions with meaningful confidence scores
```

## Running the Fixed Code

Just run your example again:
```bash
python .\use-AudioHateXplain\example.py
```

**First time:** It will download the Facebook RoBERTa model (~500MB)
**After that:** It will use the cached model and be much faster

## Expected Results

Now you should get:
1. âœ… **Better transcriptions** (from Whisper-base instead of tiny)
2. âœ… **Real hate speech predictions** (from trained classifier)
3. âœ… **Meaningful confidence scores** (not all "uncertain")
4. âœ… **Proper labels** (normal/hate based on actual content)

## Adjusting Quality vs Speed

### For Better Transcription:
In `run_AudioHateXplain.py` line ~110, change:
```python
model_size = "base.en"  # Change to "small.en" or "medium.en"
```

Options:
- `tiny.en`: Fastest, least accurate (what you had)
- `base.en`: Good balance âœ… (new default)
- `small.en`: Better accuracy, slower
- `medium.en`: Best accuracy, slowest

### For Different Hate Speech Model:
In `run_AudioHateXplain.py` line ~113, uncomment:
```python
# model_name = "Hate-speech-CNERG/dehatebert-mono-english"
```

## Your Custom ASR Model

To use your `models/AudioHateXplain/ASR/model.safetensors`, you need to add:
1. `config.json` - Model configuration
2. `preprocessor_config.json` - Audio preprocessing settings
3. `tokenizer.json` (if applicable) - Tokenizer config

Without these, the code can't load your model and will fall back to Whisper.

## Test It Now!

Run the example and you should see much better results! ðŸš€
